# WeakestLink
Scrapes employees from a LinkedIn company page, performs a number of clean up steps to remove any junk and then generates a range of possible username formats so they can be used in username enumeration and password attacks.

** Use of this extension is against LinkedIn TOS and your account may be restricted. **

Features:
- Option to retrieve headline, subline and handle for each user
- Option to generate short name versions of users for common names such as Jonathan -> John
- Clean up steps
  * Normalises any NFD characters for example รณ to o
  * Removes any none printable ASCII characters
  * Downloads a wordlist and removes postnominals
  * Downloads a wordlist and removes honorifics
  * Removes any data after a comma or curly bracket
  * Removes the dot that follows a hidden surname
  * Attempts to identify the first and last name of user
  * Identifies any common surname prefixes and appends to surname
  * Converts to lowercase and trims any redundant white space

As the first and last name fields on LinkedIn are free form text fields then there can be any random combination of data in them. Please ensure you check over the exported list as there will be dodgy names still
